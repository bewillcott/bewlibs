# BEW Libraries
This is a collection of libraries that contain various utility classes used across multiple projects.

## Status
This will be an on-going development.  The classes in the initial commit
came from my last BEWCommons commit.  All are fully functional, and bug free :).
(Atleast __I__ don't charge for them)

I have separated the classes into smaller more specialized libraries to
facilitate development and reuse.  You only need to use what you require,
instead of the whole lot.
